# MUSA5000 Assignment 2: Using Spatial Lag, Spatial Error and Geographically Weighted Regression to Predict Median House Values in Philadelphia Block Groups

**Author: Zhanchao Yang, Haoyu Zhu, Kavana Raju**

## Overview
In the previous assignment, you were asked to use OLS regression to examine the relationship between median house values and several neighborhood characteristics, using Philadelphia data at the Census block group level. For the current assignment, you will use GeoDa and ArcGIS to run spatial lag, spatial error and geographically weighted regression to see whether these methods can account for the spatial autocorrelation that might remain in the OLS residuals.

Remember that this report needs to be written as your previous submission – with an introduction, methods/results, and discussion. Do not simply copy the questions and answer them. Below, you will find an outline which you’re asked to follow when writing your report.

## Report Outline

A successful report will address the points presented in this outline. You are strongly encouraged to use the outline as a backbone for your report.

Note that this outline separates the Methods and Results sections. If you prefer to combine them, that is certainly fine as well – however, be sure to address every point in this outline.

The outline here is structured as an outline for a journal article. That is, in the Methods section, only talk about the techniques that you use, present the formulas, etc. Do not present any results in the methods section. In the Results section, actually present the output from R, any figures/screenshots, etc, and describe your output
